Hello i'm letslove <a>
My three major interests and passions are Computer Science, Maths, and Music, and I believe that there is a creative fusion between all these disciplines. I'm very passionate about sustainability, cybersecurity, and graphics. I love writing blogs on applications of deep learning and things I learn as a part of the courses I take in my free time.
